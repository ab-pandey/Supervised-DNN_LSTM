# Supervised-LSTM
Supervised LSTM is a method of forecasting in case of limited number of data. This work is an amalgamation of my work in [this repository](https://github.com/dewpeak/Rainfall-and-temperature-prediction) and [this repository](https://github.com/dewpeak/Weather-Prediction-for-Kochi-) Descriptions are provided in the notebook.
